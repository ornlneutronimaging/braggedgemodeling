# Bragg Edge Modeling

* Cross section calculation from crystal structure specification
  * Automatic calculation of diffraction peaks according to crystal structure (elements, positions, symmetry group)
* Support of texture model: March Dollase
* Peak profile modeling: Jorgensen model
* Flexible design to allow future extension to the texture and peak profile models
* Allow easy fitting to measured Bragg Edge data


Known problems:
* Debye temperature is a table. It is missing data for some elements.
